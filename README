OS X SAT SMART Driver
#####################

This is a kernel driver for Mac OS X external USB or FireWire drives.
It extends the standard driver behaviour by providing access to drive
SMART data. The interface to SMART data is same as with ATA family
driver, so most existing applications should work. 

The driver requires a SAT (SCSI ATA Translation) capable external
drive enclosure. Check smartmontools list for supported devices:
http://smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_USB-Devices 
If the Option column contains sat or jmicron, the driver should work.
The driver should work with Snow Leopard and Lion and Mountain Lion. 
People have reported problems with Lion and Encrypted volumes. 
Some enclosures are reported to work with FireWire but not with USB.
The driver is not compatible to WD Drive Manager, or enclosures 
with custom kernel extensions.

Note for Yosemite (Mac OS X 10.10) and above users
==================================================

Apple now wants us to sign drivers and extorts a very high fee for it.
Now there's no chance we will be paying for it, so disable the check if
you can.

On Yosemite, use:

  sudo nvram boot-args="kext-dev-mode=1"

On newer macOS, try (must be run in Recovery OS):

 csrutil enable --without kext

If you are using [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg),
you can move the kext file from its standard install location (/Library/Extensions/)
to the EFI OpenCore directory and load it the OC way.

The `.plugin` file is only used to support the example client. `smartctl`
does not use it.

Install
=======
 
 * Unmount external drives
 * Use the dmg image and the installer
 * Check DiskUtility. The disks should have "S.M.A.R.T. Status: Verified"


Uninstall
=========

 * Remove driver and plugin
    sudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/SATSMARTDriver.kext
    sudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/SATSMARTLib.plugin
    sudo rm -r /Library/Extensions/SATSMARTDriver.kext
    sudo rm -r /Library/Extensions/SATSMARTLib.plugin
 * Reboot


Adding enclosure identification
===============================

Check, if the enclosure is identified using shell:

ioreg -r -w 0 -c fi_dungeon_driver_IOSATDriver  | egrep 'Enclosure|PassThroughMode|Capable'|grep -v Identifiers
  |   "Enclosure Name" = "Unknown 0928:000a"
  |   "SATSMARTCapable" = Yes
  |   "PassThroughMode" = "sat16"

Add an issue to GitHub.

Compile
=======

 * Compile all targets
    make pkg

 * Unmount all existing external drives.

 * Load the kernel extension.
    sudo tail -f /private/var/log/kernel.log &
    sudo make install

 * The external drives should mount automatically.

 * Test
    cd SATSMARTDriver/build/Debug/
    ./smart_status
    ./smart_sample -a

 * Check DiskUtility. The disk should have "S.M.A.R.T. Status: Verified"

 * Install the driver to system permanently
    sudo make realinstall

 * Reboot

 * If you want to limit the driver for certain hardware add product 
   and vendor identification to SATSMARTDriver/Info.plist.
